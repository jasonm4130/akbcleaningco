I have never met him before in person but his helpfulness, promptness and enthusiasm comes across our telephone conversation as if we are just having a face to face conversation. I am an investor from Sydney and  Aaron is very knowledgeable of the Brisbane City rental market and have provided me with much insight into the residential market there to make me feel more comfortable in putting my property in his hands.  It is also the personal touch that makes him an exception.  Kudos to you Aaron Brown!<small>Albert K</small></blockquote></li><li><blockquote>Aaron has been friendly and efficient.  He communicates effectively and quickly and follows through with results.  Thanks!<small>David Fryatt</small></blockquote></li><li><blockquote>Working with Aaron Brown was fantastic. I didn't originally sign with Aaron due to exclusive access within the development we bought in, but he was still following up & making more contact than the agent who was meant to be looking after us. Aaron was a breeze & we couldn't be happier with our decision.<small>Beau Allen</small></blockquote></li><li><blockquote>We highly recommend Aaron as a property manager.We have been very impressed with the professionalism and friendliness experienced.Aaron has been extremely helpful making us feel relaxed and confident in his abilities.Within one week of listing our property on the rental market, Aaron found us a fantastic tenant, who met all our requirements.

He has been on top of things and kept me well informed.
